Title: Blackjack
AKA '21' is a card game between you and the dealer. The object of the game is to have your cards total closest or equal to 21 and have a higher total than the dealer without going over 21. Card values are indicated by the number on the card, face cards, such as a king or queen, have a value of 10, and aces have a value of 1 or 11. You win your bet (1:1) thus making 2x your bet. Blackjack is indicated by an ace and a facecard or a 10. Blackjack is paid out at 3:2 or 2.5x your bet. Once the cards are dealt you have options to Hit (take a card), Stand (not take anymore cards), or Double Down (take 1 card and double your bet). Next you will have busted (your cards total over 21) or the dealer will have a turn to hit or stand. The dealer must hit until their card values total at least 17. Whoever has the higher total without going over 21 wins the game.
